    <h2>Hello Visitor,</h2>

        <p> I'm shy so I've hidden my projects from public view, but plan to make some public in the future.
            There will be a game, and maybe some else as well. :-) I really like coding.
            Maybe if you visit some time later.

            <br>
            Kind regards,
            <br>
            Petra
        </p>
